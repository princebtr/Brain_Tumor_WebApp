        <p>
            TumorTRACE.AI is a powerful machine learning-based tool designed to assist medical professionals
            in the detection of brain tumors using MRI scans. Our tool leverages deep learning techniques to
            analyze MRI images and provide an accurate diagnosis, helping to streamline the diagnostic process
            and improve patient outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our model has been trained on thousands of brain MRI scans to differentiate between cases of brain
            tumors and non-tumorous conditions with a high degree of accuracy. By simply uploading an MRI image,
            our system will provide a diagnostic result indicating whether the scan suggests the presence of a tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
            TumorTRACE.AI is constantly improving, as we incorporate new data and enhance our algorithms. Our goal is to
            make brain tumor detection faster, more reliable, and accessible to all healthcare providers.
